> The Vertex AI API is meant for Dart command-line, cloud, and server applications.

> For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either

## What's this?

The Google Cloud client library for the Vertex AI API.

Train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal machine
learning expertise and effort.

## Quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to install the package and make your first
Vertex API request.

### Before you begin

You must create and configure a Google Cloud project before using the Vertex
AI API.

You can find complete details in this
[before you begin](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries#before_you_begin)
guide.

### Installing the package into your application

> [!TIP]
> You can create a skeleton application by running the terminal command: `dart create myapp`

Run the terminal command:

```sh
dart pub add google_cloud_aiplatform_v1beta1
```

### Make your first request

Here is an example that uses the generateContent method to send a request to
the Vertex API using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

Before running the example, you must login with the
[gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud):

```shell
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Model names must be in the form
> `'projects/{projectId}/locations/{location}/publishers/{publisher}/models/{model}'`.
>
> For example, if the Google Cloud project id were `'happycat'`, then this would
> be a valid model:
> `'projects/happycat/locations/global/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash'`.

```dart
import 'package:google_cloud_aiplatform_v1beta1/aiplatform.dart';
import 'package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart' as auth;

void main() async {
  const projectId = ''; // Enter your projectId here.
  if (projectId.isEmpty) {
    print('Please provide a project ID in the `projectId` constant.');
    return;
  }

  final client = await auth.clientViaApplicationDefaultCredentials(
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
  );
  final service = PredictionService(client: client);

  final request = GenerateContentRequest(
    model:
        'projects/$projectId/locations/global/'
        'publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents: [
      Content(
        parts: [Part(text: 'Explain how AI works in a few words')],
        role: 'user',
      ),
    ],
  );

  final result = await service.generateContent(request);
  final parts = result.candidates.firstOrNull?.content?.parts;
  if (parts == null) {
    print('<No textual response>');
  } else {
    print(parts.map((p) => p.text!).join(''));
  }

  service.close();
}
```
