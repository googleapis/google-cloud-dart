## What's this?

The Google Cloud client library for the Generative Language API.

The Gemini API allows developers to build generative AI applications using
Gemini models. Gemini is our most capable model, built from the ground up
to be multimodal. It can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate
across, and combine different types of information including language,
images, audio, video, and code. You can use the Gemini API for use cases
like reasoning across text and images, content generation, dialogue
agents, summarization and classification systems, and more.

## Quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to install the package and make your first
Gemini API request.

## Before you begin

You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can get it for
free in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)
([step-by-step instructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)).

## Installing the package into your application

> [!TIP] You can create a skeleton application by running the terminal command:
> `dart create myapp`

Run the terminal command:

```sh
dart pub add google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1
```

## Make your first request

Here is an example that uses the generateContent method to send a request to
the Gemini API using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

If you set your API key as the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY` or
`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, the API key will be picked up automatically by the client
when using the Gemini API libraries. Otherwise you will need to pass your
API key as an argument when initializing the client.

```dart
import 'package:google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1/generativelanguage.dart';

void main() async {
  // Pass your API key here if the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.
  final service = GenerativeService.fromApiKey();

  final request = GenerateContentRequest(
    model: 'models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents: [
      Content(parts: [Part(text: "Explain how AI works in a few words")]),
    ],
  );

  final result = await service.generateContent(request);
  final textResponse = result.candidates?[0].content?.parts?[0].text;
  if (textResponse == null) {
    print('<No textual response>');
  } else {
    print(textResponse);
  }

  service.close();
}
```
