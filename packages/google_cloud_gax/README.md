This library allows you to send JSON messages over an HTTP connection.

For example:

```dart
import 'package:google_cloud_gax/gax.dart';
import 'package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart';

class AnalysisRequest implements JsonEncodable {
  final String text;

  AnalysisRequest(this.text);

  @override
  Object? toJson() => {
    'document': {'type': 'PLAIN_TEXT', 'content': text},
  };
}

void main() async {
  final httpClient = clientViaApiKey('<enter your API key here>');

  final serviceClient = ServiceClient(client: httpClient);
  final response = await serviceClient.post(
    Uri.https('language.googleapis.com', '/v2/documents:analyzeSentiment'),
    body: AnalysisRequest("I am very happy! Are you sad?"),
  );
  print(response);
  serviceClient.close();
}
```
